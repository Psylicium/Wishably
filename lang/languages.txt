This is where the languages for the app resides. If you want to make a translation file in your own language (which is not already in the list), download the lang_en.php file, translate it, rename it to "lang_<yourlanguage>.php" and send it to me at psylicium@gmail.com, so I can include it. A detailed how-to is in the language file. Thanks :)

At the moment, the following translations are available:

lang_da.php		Danish
lang_en.php		English
